The most complex layer of ambiguity in PNL (the space of problems addressable by natural language) is not just semantic, but subjective and emotional. An answer is not merely processed; it is experienced. The same statement can be perceived as inspirational by one person and threatening by another. This poses a fundamental challenge for developing universally "good" LLM systems.

We can formalize this challenge by extending the concept of utility to include emotional response.

Definition 4: Emotional Valence (VE)

Let A be an answer generated for a prompt q. Let H be a population of human evaluators. For any individual human h∈H, their subjective interpretation of answer A elicits an emotional response. We can model this with an Emotional Valence Function:


VE(A,h)→R


This function maps the answer, as judged y a specific person, to a scalar value. Positive values represent desirable emotional states (e.g., feeling inspired, informed, safe), while negative values represent undesirable states (e.g., feeling scared, offended, bored). Zero represents neutrality.

Since we cannot create a single answer that maximizes VE for all h∈H, the optimal strategy for an aligned AI system is to generate an answer A that maximizes the Expected Emotional Valence across the population (the sum ranges over all h in H):


E[VE(A)]=∣H∣ ∑VE(A,h)


This formalizes the intuition of optimizing for the "average good." Furthermore, we can measure how polarizing an answer is by calculating the variance.

Definition 5: Emotional Variance (Var(VE))

The variance of the emotional valence for a given answer A is:


Var(VE(A))=E[(VE(A)−E[VE(A)])2]


A high variance indicates a contentious answer that produces strong but divergent reactions. A low variance indicates a consensual response, whether positive, neutral, or negative.

Example: Emotional Valence and Variance

● Prompt: "What is the role of art in society?"

● Answer A1 (Low Variance): "Art serves multiple roles, including cultural expression, social commentary, and aesthetic pleasure. It has been a fundamental part of human civilization for millennia."

○ Expected Response: Most people would find this informative and neutral. E[VE(A1)] would likely be slightly positive, and Var(VE(A1)) would be low.

● Answer A2 (High Variance): "Art is a revolutionary tool to dismantle oppressive power structures. Any art that does not serve a political purpose is a decadent distraction for the bourgeoisie."

○ Expected Response: This answer is polarizing. Some individuals (h1) might find it incredibly inspirational (VE(A2,h1)=+9.5). Others (h2) might find it offensive and dangerously simplistic (VE(A2,h2)=−8.0). While the mean E[VE(A2)] might be low or moderate, the variance Var(VE(A2)) would be extremely high.

This framework shows that developing LLMs is not just about semantic accuracy, but also about navigating a complex emotional landscape. The choice between generating a low-variance, "safe" answer and a high-variance, "bold" answer becomes an explicit design choice with quantifiable trade-offs.
